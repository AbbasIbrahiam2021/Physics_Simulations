# Physics_Simulations

Some physics simulations written in Python and Javascript that was used to train an LLM

Typically the script is structured as follows:
1. Set up some array or tkinter/Three.js structure
2. Populate the environment with objects
3. Build a routine which simulates some physical process, often by solving a partial differential equation

The simulation are in all sorts of scenarios from gas escaping to forest fires
